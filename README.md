# 🧮 JavaScript Calculator

A fully functional web calculator built with vanilla JavaScript as part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. This project demonstrates core programming concepts and DOM manipulation skills.

## ✨ Features

- **🔢 Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **⚡ Exponentiation**: Power calculations with the `^` operator
- **🎯 Smart Decimal Handling**: Prevents multiple decimal points in a single number
- **🎨 Visual Feedback**: Active operator highlighting for better user experience
- **🛡️ Input Validation**: Prevents erroneous calculations after displaying results
- **🔄 State Management**: Proper handling of operands and operations with automatic reset
- **😄 Error Handling**: Custom message for division by zero attempts

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **DOM Manipulation**: Efficient element selection and event handling
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Multiple event listeners with proper attachment/removal
- **State Management**: Tracking calculator state across user interactions
- **Function Composition**: Modular code with single-responsibility functions
- **Array Methods**: Using `reduce()` for operation execution
- **User Experience**: Input disabling/enabling to prevent calculation errors

## 🎮 How It Works

1. Click digits to build numbers
2. Select an operator to set the operation
3. Enter the second operand
4. Press equals to see the result
5. Clear button resets everything for new calculations

Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS - no frameworks required! 🚀
